FInal Project for Connected Systems module UCL


# To Do List:
1. Array of Days of Week to keep track of data per day when uploading to cloud
2. Array could be a 2D array to store both Day of Week and Openening Times for that Day.
3. Keep track of hours (possibly for loop) so that device will run for only opening times.
4. Create Dummy data for a couple weeks to have an example of how data will be presented
